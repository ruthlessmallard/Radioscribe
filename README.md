## Overview

RadioScribe monitors radio traffic through your phone's microphone, transcribes speech offline using Vosk, and alerts you when critical keywords are detected. Built for underground mining environments.

## Alert Tiers

| Level | Trigger | Color | Behavior |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| Normal | No match | White | Scrolls off naturally |
| Warning | Keyword match | industrial Yellow | Pinned, swipe to dismiss |
| Safety | Safety keyword | tool handle Red | Pinned top, alarm after 20s |

## Setup Before Building

### 1. Vosk Model
Download the small English model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

- Recommended: `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`
- Extract into `assets/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/`

### 2. Alarm Sound
Place an `alarm.mp3` file in `assets/sounds/`

### 3. Build
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

## Vosk Integration (TODO)

The `AudioService` in `lib/services/audio_service.dart` has a `_simulateRecognition()` placeholder. Replace with real Vosk calls:

1. Load model: `VoskFlutterPlugin.instance().initModel('assets/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15')`
2. Start recognizer with silence threshold from `KeywordConfig.silenceThresholdMs`
3. On partial result: update `_partialText`
4. On final result: push to `_segmentController`
